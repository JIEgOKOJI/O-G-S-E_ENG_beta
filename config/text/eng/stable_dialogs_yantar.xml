Apparently, zombies kamikaze chrezychayno accelerated metabolism. Perhaps this can explain their ability to explode.

		<text>Oh-oh-oh ... Marked One, you touch on one of the most interesting and challenging aspects of my labors! But try to explain. \ NVremya Terror, as it is called a stalker, a psionic character. You see, with uncertain intervals in the exclusion zone so-called "conventional" emissions are accompanied by massive emissions of psy-radiation, causing people hallucinations and delusions. This radiation is different from that with which we deal here at Yantar. It is not as intense, but has the ability to travel considerable distances, almost without losing their properties. Unfortunately, the propagation of radiation is such that the exact location of the source is impossible. I can only say that it's pretty far away. \nThat's all I know about it.</text>
