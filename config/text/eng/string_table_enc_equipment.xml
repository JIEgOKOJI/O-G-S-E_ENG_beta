In addition, the shock wave sufficiently large explosive charge deprives a person of conscience; high temperature explosive gases can cause serious burns to the lower extremities. Death may occur from a painful shock, blood loss in the event of failure in first aid. Mina can be installed on the ground and in ground, in the snow, in all cases, translation mine in the firing position by hand. The term combat operation is not limited to mines.

		<text>This amazing device allows you to detect at a distance of 50 meters, many life forms, like warm-blooded and cold-blooded. Principle of its operation is described in detail in the monograph of Professor Bolshakov, "Practical application of the unique properties of the artifact ZX-232" Crystal Ball "in the field, as well as in the thesis assistant Semenov" Biological organisms as natural radio transceivers.
                Briefly describe the operation of the device can be so: the majority of living organisms emit during the movement of electromagnetic waves that can zapelengovat and measure their frequency, intensity and determine the source position in space. When you work the muscles, the nerve fiber to muscle bundle receives electrical impulses, and the living tissue, and tissue, which retain their current conductivity become microtransmitter.
                Quite a long time it was thought that due to the extreme weakness of the signals to pinpoint their possible only under laboratory conditions, using bulky amplifying equipment - according to this principle worked and work, so-called "auroskopy" - devices that fix around the living body "aura" which is, in fact, electromagnetic radiation of a certain range. During the study the various artifacts Zone scientists came upon a very interesting effect of one of the subjects - an artifact, "Crystal Ball".
                A small handheld radio assistant Semenova unexpectedly began to take a signal of private radio station, located in a provincial area of Argentina. Having studied the unusual phenomenon, the collective scientific camps came to the only plausible explanation: an artifact of the "Crystal Ball" amplifies and filters the noise from the radio ordered. Obviously, the microscopic part of the Argentine radio receiving a signal present at the location of the camp, but was so small that no powerful receivers have not been able to fix it.
                However, it was worth only bring a console connection to a stationary camp "Crystal Ball", as the noise from the air began to be heard hundreds of voices in the further setting up successfully filtered out and caught almost all the signals available on a range of remote communication transmitters, the most distant of which was at a distance of 14 thousands of miles!
                To develop the project "Crystal interception immediately imposed a stamp" top secret ", but until that time, some devices made with such amazing properties, yet the public domain. The device "bioradar Peleng radiation of living tissues of the body, filtering them by frequency and distance. As a result, conventional liquid crystal display you can see the marks that indicate living organisms. Since the unit was created primarily for exploration in the Zone, an assistant Semenov uploaded to the database device information about the frequencies most often emitted by members of the local fauna. Unfortunately, the organisms are the Zone as quickly mutate, that in a few weeks a list of frequencies had to be updated. However, the resourceful stalkers among the first winners of the device, invented a simple, though barbaric way bearing mutants: If a device is best at the waist, put a sample of biological tissue of the monster types you want to pinpoint - the device will automatically reset, and mutants of the desired type will be displayed. The disadvantages of the device is its high cost.</text>
